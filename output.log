Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, they decided to play in the mud. They made mud pies and splashed each other. It was so much fun!
After a while, Lily's mom called her inside for a snack. She made her a sour lemonade to take with her to play. Lily took a sip and made a face. She said, "This lemonade is sour!"
Later that day, Lily went to the park with her friends. They played on the swings and the slide. But Lily saw something funny happening. Her friend said, "I'm going to rock back and forth!" But Lily remembered the sour lemonade. She said, "No, I don't like sour lemonade." Her friends laughed and said, "It's okay, we can find something else to do inside." And they all went home happy.achieved tok/s: 60.112360
